## What is Glodroid

Glodroid is a project that adapts Android Open-Source Project to support Orange Pi platform in a way that is:

   * Open and free as much as it's possible;
   * Up-to-date version of Android;
   * Close to mainline Android as much as it's possible;
   * Provided with necessary libraries and software so user/customer could have up and running latest Android OS with no efforts
